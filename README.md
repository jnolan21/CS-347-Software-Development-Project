# CS-347-Software-Development-Project

Final project for CS 347: Software Development at Stevens Institute of Technology.


Final Project Description:

Our team is developing a software solution for the Alset “Hug the Lanes” project. IoT will be used to develop the software for a self-driving assistant car that will be cheaper, more efficient, and safer than the current models being produced. Self-driving cars are the future of ensuring the roads are safe to ultimately decrease the number of accidents and deaths. The software is a mission-critical, real-time embedded system that is responsible for assisting drivers and ensuring their safety on the road. The implementation of an array of features and specifications will allow our software to make real-time decisions and react to road condition changes. Every feature is designed with the driver’s safety in mind, as we want to guarantee the safety of all our customers. Throughout the entirety of every drive, data will be collected, allowing the software to recognize the error and adjust accordingly. This will ensure that the software is updated in regards to the driver's road conditions. Ultimately our goal is to successfully develop and deliver a safe self-driving assistant car.
